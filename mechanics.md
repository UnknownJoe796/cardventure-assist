# Encounter Mechanics

- Everyone plays initiative from their hand, establishing turn order.
- You can do as many actions on your turn as you can sanely justify.
  - Example: Duck behind cover and shoot someone is perfectly valid.
- Actions can be countered via a play by the opponent, if justifiable.
  - Example: Blocking a punch using Clubs + Spades
  - Example: Attempting to avoid a shot by dodging with Spades
- After their turn, the player may draw up to their limit.
- Purposeful wait - a player may purposefully delay an action, changing their turn order.
- Refresh - Make no actions on a turn and draw up to your limit + 1 AND shuffle your discard back into your deck.
- Exhaustion - Once your deck is out, you have to refresh.
