# Encounter Mechanics

- Everyone plays initiative from their hand, establishing turn order.
- You can do as many actions on your turn as you can sanely justify.
  - Example: Duck behind cover and shoot someone is perfectly valid.
- Actions can be countered via a play by the opponent, if justifiable.
  - Example: Blocking a punch using Clubs + Spades
  - Example: Attempting to avoid a shot by dodging with Spades
- After their turn, the player may draw (limit - 1) cards, up to their limit.
  - Purpose: using all cards every turn keeps you tired, where you have less cards.  Gives strategy to saving a card for another turn.
- Purposeful wait - a player may purposefully delay an action, changing their turn order.
- Refresh - Make no actions on a turn to discard any undesired cards then draw up to your limit.
